INSTALL
=======

For more complete instructions, see the "Admins/Workstations" section in `ddr-manual <https://github.com/densho/ddr-manual/>`_.

The `ddr-local` install and update scripts below have been tested on Debian 7.0 running as a VM in VirtualBox.
They install `ddr-local` and `ddr-cmdln` in `/opt` rather than in a `virtualenv`, so it is recommended that you install in a virtual machine.


Initial Installation
--------------------

Run the `install.sh` script to do the initial installation.  It usually takes 5-7 minutes.

# Log in.
# Make sure your user can sudo.
$ git clone https://github.com/densho/ddr-local.git
$ cd ddr-local/ddrlocal
$ sh bin/install.sh

The first thing the script does is add a `ddr` user.  You will be asked for a password.  The install is automatic after that point.


Update
------

Once the application is installed, you can update it using the `update.sh` script.

$ cd /usr/local/src/ddr-local/ddrlocal
$ sh bin/update.sh
